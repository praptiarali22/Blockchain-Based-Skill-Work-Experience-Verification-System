# 🌟 Blockchain-Based Skill & Work Experience Verification System 🌟

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **Blockchain-Based Skill and Work Experience Verification System** designed to securely validate individuals' skills and work experience. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency, immutability, and trust in the verification process.

## ✨ Features
- 🛡️ **Decentralized Platform:** Built on blockchain to prevent tampering and ensure data integrity.
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface:** HTML and CSS-based interface for ease of use.
- 🤖 **Smart Contracts:** Solidity-based smart contracts for automated verification processes.
- 🔒 **Secure Back-End:** Python-powered backend for seamless integration and secure operations.
- 💾 **Relational Database Support:** SQL is used for storing and managing data efficiently.
- 📝 **Job Enrollment (Coming Soon):** Employees can enroll for jobs, and HR can verify submitted details.
- 💬 **HR Messaging System:** HR can send messages directly to employees regarding verification updates.
- 🏆 **Certificate Generation:** When an employee leaves a company, the HR can generate a blockchain-based certificate attesting to their skills and work experience. This certificate can be presented to other companies as proof of employment and can be verified by the new HR.


## 🛠️ Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Python
- **Blockchain:** Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- **Database:** SQL
- **Blockchain Tools:** MetaMask, Ganache, Remix IDE
- **Additional Libraries/Tools:** Flask , Web3.js (for blockchain interactions).

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. Users submit their skills, work experience, and supporting documents.
2. HR verifies the submitted claims and sends feedback or approval messages to employees.
3. Once an employee leaves the company, HR generates a **blockchain-based certificate** that attests to their skills and experience.
4. The certificate can be presented to other companies where HR can verify its authenticity using the blockchain network.
5. Validated claims and certificates are stored on the blockchain to ensure tamper-proof records.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Blockchain Tools
1. **MetaMask Setup:**
   - Install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/).
   - Create or import a wallet and connect it to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache or Testnet).
2. **Ganache Setup:**
   - Download and install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
   - Start a local blockchain network for testing purposes.
   - Configure MetaMask to use the Ganache network.
3. **Remix IDE:**
   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Use Remix to write, test, and deploy the Solidity smart contracts to the Ganache network or other blockchain networks.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
To set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
